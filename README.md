terrarium
=========

Eloquent Javascript - terrarium project<br><br>

basic program from following the chapter and added exercises are done<br><br><br>


next to implement:<br><br>


-world randomizer with various options<br>

--clean up and organize code better!  maybe split into more files, etc<br>

--add more lifeforms? (maybe have to introduce critter 'class' or 'type')<br>
ideas: virus-turns other lifeforms into virii<br>
        competing herbivores/carnivores<br>
        vine - plant that hugs walls(use wall follower movement code)<br>
        carnivorous plant - doesn't move, but eats anything that ends up next to it<br>
        evolver - starts as plant, becomes herbivore at certain level, then carnivore, then splits into two baby evolvers<br>

--add way to save layout???? (with localstorage or later w/ rails or node?)<br><br>

--add ability to edit lifeform properties on page?<br>
