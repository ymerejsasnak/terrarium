terrarium
=========

Eloquent Javascript - terrarium project<br><br>

basic program from following the chapter and added exercises are done<br><br><br>


next to implement:<br><br>
--each creature's color based on energy level (this is implemented but probably should reverse it so brighter colors represent higher energy levels<br>
--remake start/stop button<br><br>
--add more functionality to page:<br>
buttons to reset simulation<br>
editor feature to define starting world<br>
add way to save layout? (with localstorage or later w/ rails?)<br><br>
--add more lifeforms?(virii, bugs, competing herbivores/carnivores, etc(idea: vine - plant that hugs walls)(maybe have to introduce critter 'class' or 'type')<br>
--add ability to edit lifeform properties on page?<br>
--clean up and organize code better!  maybe split into more files, etc<br>
