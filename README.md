Unrealistic Life Simulator<br>
(expanded from the "electronic life" project from Eloquent Javascript)<br><br><br>


Future TO DO:<br><br>


--clean up, organize code better, refactor, maybe split into more files, tweak ui and display (add more instructions?), tweak stats, etc<br>

--add way to save/load with localstorage(popup divs) (save in json)  (start with just one at a time)<br>

--change it so walls only have shadows on bottom and rightmost walls?

--add handler for right click (see 'contextmenu') to edit spawner rate and entities (checkboxes to select which ones it spawns)
