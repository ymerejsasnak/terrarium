=========

Unrealistic Life Simulator<br>
(expanded from the "electronic life" project from Eloquent Javascript)<br><br><br>


TO DO:<br><br>


--clean up, organize code better, refactor, maybe split into more files, etc<br>

--add way to save layout with localstorage (save in json?)<br>

--improve look of controls<br>

--add instructions and visual legend (popup div)<br><br>

--add more lifeforms (maybe have to introduce critter 'class' or 'type')<br>
ideas: virus-turns other lifeforms into virii<br>
        competing herbivores/carnivores<br>
        carnivorous plant - doesn't move, but eats anything that ends up next to it<br>
        evolver - starts as plant, becomes herbivore at certain level, then carnivore, then splits into two baby evolvers<br>
        conway rule cell<br>
