Unrealistic Life Simulator<br>
(expanded from the "electronic life" project from Eloquent Javascript)<br><br><br>


TO DO:<br><br>


--clean up, organize code better, refactor, maybe split into more files, etc<br>

--add evolver2 and evolver3 to selector to edit them in like that<br>
--organize selector into kingdoms,etc<br>
--make carnivores eat each other when starving?<br>


--make random button only add to non-wall cells, or maybe only empty cells?<br>


--add way to save/load layout with localstorage (save in json?)<br>
--preset level ideas:  existing default world ('circle of life?'), "rabbits in the swamp" (vines, flytraps, herbivores),<br>
                       "sprial of death" (walls in spiral shape FILLED with carnivores, with one virus at the end (visual fun));<br>
                       plant world (plant, vine, flytrap, and include evolvers);<br>
                       comparison level: split down middle by wall, exactly the same on both sides initially<br>
                       evolver world: only evolvers<br>

--add instructions and visual legend (popup div)<br><br>

--more animal lifeforms? omnivore (can eat EVERY lifeform except virus)<br>
                     diseased carnivore (chance to become virus upon death<br>
                     creator block -- periodically adds a random lifeform next to it<br>
                     porcupine -- # -- herbivore that can't be eaten by carnivores (but can by omnivore)...can eat flytrap

--lifeform notes:  evolvers should be allowed to eat their own kind if its a lesser form<br>
                  tweak stats on everything if necessary<br>
                  sometimes a single vine won't grow for some reason? (maybe after being boxed in it doesn't get a new direction??)
