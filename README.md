=========

Unrealistic Life Simulator<br>
(expanded from the "electronic life" project from Eloquent Javascript)<br><br><br>


TO DO:<br><br>


--clean up, organize code better, refactor, maybe split into more files, tweak ui, tweak stats, etc<br>

--(what is this css color error from?? doesn't seem to have any effect.  must be in js not css itself? (now it's gone?!?!?!))<br>



--add FILL button that fills grid with selectd element



--add way to save/load with localstorage(popup divs) (save in json)  (may need seperate selector for my default maps and a user's maps<br>

--preset level ideas:  existing default world ('circle of life?'), "rabbits in the swamp" (vines, flytraps, herbivores),<br>
                       "sprial of death" (walls in spiral shape FILLED with carnivores, with one virus at the end (visual fun));<br>
                       plant world (plant, vine, flytrap, and include evolvers);<br>
                       comparison level: split down middle by wall, exactly the same on both sides initially<br>
 



--add instructions and visual legend and about info(popup div)<br><br>



--maybe in future add an options button (with another popup div) that lets you change some of the creature settings<br>
