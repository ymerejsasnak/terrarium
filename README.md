Unrealistic Life Simulator<br>
(expanded from the "electronic life" project from Eloquent Javascript)<br><br><br>


TO DO:<br><br>


--clean up, organize code better, refactor, maybe split into more files, etc<br>

--add way to save/load layout with localstorage (save in json?)<br>
--preset level ideas:  existing default world ('circle of life?'), "rabbits in the swamp" (vines, flytraps, herbivores),
                       "sprial of death" (walls in spiral shape FILLED with carnivores, with one virus at the end (visual fun));

--improve UI<br>

--add instructions and visual legend (popup div)<br><br>

--lifeform notes:  should evolvers be allowed to eat their own kind if its a lesser form?<br>
                  tweak stats on everything if necessary
