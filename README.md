terrarium
=========

Eloquent Javascript - terrarium project<br><br>

basic program from following the chapter and added exercises are done<br><br><br>


next to implement:<br><br>


--add more functionality to page:<br>
(right now reset button only reloads page...figure out way to get it set back to its initial state instead?)<br>

editor feature to define starting world (with clear button, maybe button to reset to started layout, etc)<br>

add way to save layout? (with localstorage or later w/ rails or node?)<br><br>


--add more lifeforms?(virii, bugs, competing herbivores/carnivores, etc(idea: vine - plant that hugs walls)(maybe have to introduce critter 'class' or 'type')<br>

--add ability to edit lifeform properties on page?<br>

--clean up and organize code better!  maybe split into more files, etc<br>
