=========

Unrealistic Life Simulator<br>
(expanded from the "electronic life" project from Eloquent Javascript)<br><br><br>


TO DO:<br><br>


--clean up, organize code better, refactor, maybe split into more files, etc<br>

--add way to save/load layout with localstorage (save in json?)<br>

--improve UI<br>

--add instructions and visual legend (popup div)<br><br>

--add more lifeforms (maybe have to introduce critter 'class' or 'type')<br>
ideas:  carnivorous plant - doesn't move, but eats anything (just animals?) that ends up next to it<br>
        evolver - starts as plant, becomes herbivore, then carnivore, then splits into two baby evolvers (in code, parent will just revert 'form' property back to plant rather than MAKING 2 babies)<br>
