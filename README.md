##Unrealistic Life Simulator
###(expanded from the "electronic life" project from Eloquent Javascript)

My favorite of my javascript projects!  (But the code is a mess!!!)

####TO DO:
* clean up, organize code better, refactor, maybe split into more files, tweak ui and display (add more instructions?), tweak stats, etc
* add way to save/load with localstorage(popup divs) (save as json)  (start with just one at a time)
* change it so walls only have shadows on bottom and rightmost walls?
* add handler for right click (see 'contextmenu') to edit spawner rate and entities (checkboxes to select which ones it spawns)
